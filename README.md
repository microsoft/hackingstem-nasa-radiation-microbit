# Introduction

Microcontroller code for Microsoft Hacking STEM What is the electromagnetic spectrum? lesson plan adapted for micro:bit

This spectrometer project uses LEDs as light sensors (photodiode) to detect and measure different wavelengths in various types of light sources.

# Getting Started
1.	Download lesson assets at https://aka.ms/hackingSTEM
2.	Build the spectrometer!
3.	Use [Mu](https://codewith.mu/) to flash the NasaRadiationMicrobit.py to the 
[micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) microcontroller.
4.	Verify data interactions in Excel
5. Go forth and science all the things!
